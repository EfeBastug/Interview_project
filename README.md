# Interview_project
The completed interview project which uses TypeScript and React. It is a simple project that fills the clicked squares with X and when clicked again, deletes the X. There is also a take back button, which, when pressed, reverses the last action taken. If there are no actions to be taken, it displays an error message. Since the node_modules directoy was deleted to save space, the commands (npm install --save-dev @types/react) or just (npm install) may need to be executed in the src/app directory for the project to work.
